# Nothing

**Nothing** is the cleanest, best-running program you have ever experienced. Designed by me, and remains to be the most reliable thing I have ever written.

- **Cross-platform**

   A revolutionary non-existing framework means unrestricted compatibility.
   
- **High Performance**
  
  A staggering **0 second** execution time with **0%** CPU useage.

- **Simple deployment**

  No makefiles, No docker containers, No setup files.

- **Secure**

   100% Hack-proof, as there are no vulnerabilities.

- **Reliable**

   Guaranteed to never run and never do anything ever.

## New Features!

  - Starting in version v1.0, doesn't do anything.
  
You can also:
  - Run nothing.
  - Write Nothing.
  - Install no plug-ins
  - Contribute in no way whatsoever.
  
### Installation

**Nothing** requires nothing to run. Just clone, and it's ready for no use.

```sh
$ cd Nothing
```
Or for production environments...

```sh
$ sudo cd Nothing
```
  
### Development

Want to contribute? Please don't.

### Todos

 - Cry.
